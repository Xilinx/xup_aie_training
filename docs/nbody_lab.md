# N-Body Simulation lab

Coming soon
<!--
## Introduction

An [N-body simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation) approximates the motion of particles that interact to each other through a physical force.

This lab is adapted from the Vitis Tutorials, for more detailed information check out [AI_Engine_Development/Design_Tutorials/08-n-body-simulator](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/tree/2022.2/AI_Engine_Development/Design_Tutorials/08-n-body-simulator).

## Goal

# Design Overview

The N-Body Simulator is implemented on the [VCK5000 Versal Development Card](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/vck5000.html) (XCVC1902 Versal ACAP device). It consists of PL HLS datamover kernels from the Vitis Utility Library (m2s_x2 and s2m_x4), custom HLS kernels that enable packet switching (packet_sender and packet_receiver), and a 400 tile AI Engine design. Additionally, the design consists of host applications that enable the entire design, verify the data coming out of the AI Engine, and run the design for multiple timesteps.


## Steps

### Run make

The xclbin container is build via a Makefile flow.
