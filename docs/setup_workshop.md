# Instructor-led XUP tutorial: Connecting to AWS

The following instructions are for live, instructor-led XUP tutorials where AWS EC2 instances have been set by AMD and login details have been provided to attendees. You can check the [AMD XUP workshop schedule]https://www.xilinx.com/support/university/workshops.html) for upcoming training. Ask your instructor if you do not have your login details. If you are **not** attending a live XUP tutorial, go back to the [Quick Start](README.md) page and follow one of the other options to work through these labs.

## Introduction

This lab will show you how to start, stop, and connect to a preconfigured AWS EC2 instance.

## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Connect to an AWS EC2 instance using the provided credentials

* Start the instance

* Connect to the instance using remote desktop software

* Stop the instance

* Run the [Setup VCK5000 platform](#setup-vck5000-platform) to configure the development platform in the system

## Steps

Each registered participant to AMD tutorial has been allocated a preconfigured EC2 instance. You should have received an email with the following details:  

* Account ID

* IAM username

* Link to access a pre-configured EC2 instance

If this is not the case, please contact one of your instructors

### Login into the AWS and starting an F1 instance

1. Follow the link provided by your instructor, or go to [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2).

    If you see the login page for *Root user*, click the link to sign in to a different account.

1. Select **IAM user** and use the account ID provided by your instructor (E.g. `xilinx-aws-f1-developer-labs`) in *Account ID (12 digits) or account alias*.

1. Use the username and password provided by your instructor

1. In the top right corner make sure to select the AWS region specified by your instructor (E.g. N. Virginia).

    ![Select Region](images/aws_connect/FigConnectingLab-3.png)

    If the wrong region is selected you will not be able to see your instance.

1. Click on the **Services** in the menu bar at the top of the screen and click on **EC2** to see the available instances.

    ![Select EC2](images/aws_connect/FigConnectingLab-4-2.png)

    You can also click on the **Instances** link on the left panel

    ![Select Instance](images/aws_connect/FigConnectingLab-5.png)

    You may see several instances.

1. Find the instance that matches your username. If you need to check your username, the account you are logged in as is visible in the menu bar at the top of the screen

    You can enter your *username* in the *Filter instances* box to filter the list

    ![Filtering by User](images/aws_connect/FigConnectingLab-6.png)

1. Select your instance (tick the checkbox) and click on **Instance state > Start**

    ![Start instance](images/aws_connect/FigConnectingLab-7.png)

1. Click on the refresh button to check the status of the instance. It will take about a few seconds before the instance is ready

    ![Refresh](./images/aws_connect/Fig-refresh.png)

    Keep refreshing the status until you see the *Instance state* update to **Running**. This means the instance is now ready for you to connect to it

    ![Running instance](./images/aws_connect/instance_running.png)

1. With your instance selected, view the instance *Details* in the bottom part of the page. You can resize the page to make this section easier to view. Find the *Public IPv4 address* and copy it. Notice the copy button that will automatically copy the IP address to your clipboard ![Copy Button](./images/aws_connect/copy_button.png).

    This address will be used by to access the remote instance.

## Connect to your remote instance

Your instance has been preconfigured to allow you to connect to a remote desktop for your instance using NICE DCV.

You can also ssh to AWS instances (E.g. using PuTTY, MobaXterm, etc.) if you only need a terminal. See [Appendix: ssh using PuTTY](#ssh-using-putty) for details.

### Connect using NICE DCV

NICE DCV is recommended by Amazon for use with AWS instances. This is also the recommended way to connect to your instance for this tutorial.

* Download and install [NICE DCV client](https://download.nice-dcv.com) (Windows\|Mac\|Linux)

The NICE DCV session has already been started on the pre-configured instance.

1. Open the NICE DCV application on your computer, enter the *IPv4 Public IP* from the Amazon console and click **Open**

    ![Connect to NiceDCV](./images/aws_connect/nice_dcv.png)

1. The first time a certificate warning will be displayed. Click **Trust** to continue

1. When prompted, enter the **Instance ssh\RDP credentials:** username and password provided by your instructor  (E.g. username: **ubuntu**). Note that this is different to the username that you used to log in to AWS. 

    ![Instance Desktop](./images/aws_connect/nice_dcv_desktop.png)

1. Continue to [Get Source Code](setup_tools.md#get-source-code)

## Appendix

### SSH using PuTTY

1. Start **PuTTY** or your preferred SSH client

1. Enter *ubuntu@<IPv4\_Public\_IP>* in the **Host Name** field and **22** in the *Port* field  
    Make sure that SSH is selected as the Connection type

    ![PuTTY Configuration](images/aws_connect/FigConnectingLab-15.png)

1. Click **Open** and then **Yes** when PuTTY Security Alert is shown

    The PuTTY window will open. It will ask for the password (in case of the workshop). Enter the provided password

    ![PuTTY Console](images/aws_connect/FigConnectingLab-17.png)

1. Enter **exit** to close the session

### Set up the NICE DCV session

1. Open PuTTY, and ssh to your instance as described on [SSH using PuTTY](#ssh-using-putty)

1. On the terminal, enter the following command to start the DCV server:

   ```sh
   dcv create-session --user ubuntu ubuntu
   ```

   By default NICE DCV runs in the TCP port `8443`

1. Verify dcv session

   If the output of `dcv list-sessions` should look like:

   ```sh
   Session: 'ubuntu' (owner: ubuntu)
   ```
